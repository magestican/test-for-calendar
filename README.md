# test-for-calendar

Attached you will find the PSD for an activity log.

The log literally logs every user interaction users have with our app.
The log will be for the app that you can find at cogsworth.com

Your task is to make the PSD into a functional standalone app. The app needs to:
Have API endpoints that will allow us to pass through:
Statuses
Dates and times
Actions
User names
Have outputs that are as pictured in the PSD, and that can be filtered by action, status, date (today, yesterday, this week, last week, this month, last month and custom range - like the one that Google Analytics has :
Inline images 1


Basically what we are looking for is your ability to interpret this task, understand it, code it well and quickly and have it not need to be integrated with our existing app by anything other than an API.
